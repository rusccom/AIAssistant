## Solution Design

![Architecture](images/solution_design.png)

### Architecture Overview

This application implements a real-time speech-to-speech health assistant using a WebSocket-based architecture that enables bidirectional audio streaming between the browser and the Amazon Nova Sonic model.

### Key Architectural Components

1. **Frontend (Browser)**
   - WebAudio API for audio capture and playback
   - Socket.IO client for real-time WebSocket communication
   - Web-based UI for conversation monitoring and agent actions

2. **Backend (Node.js Server)**
   - Express.js HTTP server with Socket.IO for WebSocket management
   - TypeScript-based AI agent orchestration engine
   - Direct integration with AWS Bedrock services
   - Session management for concurrent users

3. **AWS Services**
   - Amazon Nova Sonic for speech-to-speech AI capabilities
   - Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base for health information retrieval
   - Vector database for semantic search

### Security Requirements for Remote Deployment

**Important**: This application requires secure contexts (HTTPS) for microphone access when deployed beyond localhost.

#### Why SSL/TLS is Required

Modern browsers enforce strict security policies for accessing sensitive APIs like `getUserMedia()` (microphone access):

- **Localhost Exception**: Browsers allow microphone access over HTTP only on `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
- **Remote Access Requirement**: Any other hostname (including EC2 public IPs, custom domains, or local network IPs) requires HTTPS
- **Browser Security Model**: This is a fundamental browser security feature to protect users from unauthorized audio/video capture

## AI Agentic Architecture

This application demonstrates advanced AI agent capabilities through Nova Sonic's intelligent tool selection and orchestration:

### **Tool System Overview**

The AI agent has access to **7 specialized tools** that it selects autonomously based on user intent:

#### **Health Information Tools**
1. **`retrieve_health_info`** - Searches the health knowledge base for medical information
2. **`greeting`** - Provides personalized introductions and welcomes
3. **`safety_response`** - Handles inappropriate requests with proper boundaries

#### **Appointment Management Tools**
4. **`check_doctor_availability`** - Queries doctor schedules by specialty or ID
5. **`check_appointments`** - Retrieves existing appointments for patients or doctors
6. **`schedule_appointment`** - Books new appointments after collecting required information
7. **`cancel_appointment`** - Cancels existing appointments with proper confirmation

### **Intelligent Tool Orchestration**

The Nova Sonic model demonstrates sophisticated reasoning by:
- **Context-aware tool selection**: Automatically chooses appropriate tools based on user queries
- **Multi-step workflows**: Chains tools together (e.g., check availability → collect info → schedule appointment)
- **Information validation**: Ensures all required data is collected before executing actions
- **Safety prioritization**: Always applies safety checks before processing requests

### **Agentic Behavior Examples**

```
User: "I need to see a cardiologist next week"
Agent Process:
1. Uses check_doctor_availability with specialty="Cardiology"
2. Presents available options with calendar formatting
3. Collects patient information systematically
4. Uses schedule_appointment only after all data is gathered
5. Confirms booking with appointment details
```

The agent maintains conversation context across tool calls and provides natural, flowing interactions while ensuring all safety and business logic requirements are met.

### Health Knowledge Base Workflow

```
User Speech → Amazon Nova Sonic → Safety Check → Tool Use Detection → Bedrock KB Query → 
                                       ↓                                         ↓
                               Emergency Response                            Vector DB
                                       ↓                                         ↓
User ← Audio Output ← Amazon Nova Sonic ← Safety Response ← Retrieved Health Context
```

## Deployment Considerations

This application is primarily designed for **local development on your laptop**, which minimizes costs and complexity. However, it can also be deployed on EC2 or other computing platforms with proper SSL configuration.

### Recommended Deployment

- **Primary**: Local laptop/desktop (localhost:4000)
  - No SSL certificates needed
  - No hosting costs
  - Immediate development and testing
  - Full microphone access

- **Secondary**: EC2 or cloud instances
  - Requires SSL setup (see Architecture section)
  - Additional hosting costs
  - Suitable for demos and sharing

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### AWS Service Costs

When running this application, you will incur costs for:

1. **Amazon Bedrock**
   - **Nova Sonic model**: Charged per input/output tokens
   - **Knowledge Base**: Storage and retrieval costs
   - **Vector database (OpenSearch Serverless)**: Minimum charges apply even when idle

2. **AWS S3** (for Knowledge Base documents)
   - Storage costs for uploaded health documents
   - Generally minimal for demo purposes

3. **EC2 Instance** (if deployed remotely)
   - Instance hourly rates based on type
   - t3.micro eligible for free tier
   - Costs vary by instance type and region

### Cost Optimization Tips

- **Development**: Use localhost to avoid EC2 costs
- **Testing**: Limit conversation length to reduce token usage
- **Knowledge Base**: Use minimum documents needed for testing
- **Shut down resources** when not in use

## 🧹 Cleanup Instructions

To avoid ongoing charges, follow these steps to delete all resources:

### 1. Stop the Application

```bash
# Stop the Node.js server
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server

# If running on EC2, also stop the instance
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <your-instance-id>
```

### 2. Delete Bedrock Knowledge Base

```bash
# List knowledge bases
aws bedrock-agent list-knowledge-bases

# Delete the knowledge base (replace with your KB ID)
aws bedrock-agent delete-knowledge-base --knowledge-base-id YOUR_KB_ID

# Note: This may take several minutes
```

### 3. Clean Up S3 Bucket

```bash
# List and delete objects in your KB bucket
aws s3 rm s3://your-kb-bucket-name --recursive

# Delete the bucket
aws s3 rb s3://your-kb-bucket-name
```

### 4. Delete OpenSearch Serverless Collection

If you created an OpenSearch Serverless collection for the Knowledge Base:

1. Go to AWS Console → OpenSearch Service
2. Select "Serverless collections"
3. Find your collection and delete it
4. Also delete any associated security policies

Note: If you are using a different vector store, please check our document pages for more details.

### 5. Terminate EC2 Instance (if used)

```bash
# Terminate EC2 instance permanently
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <your-instance-id>

# Delete associated security groups
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id <security-group-id>

# Release Elastic IP (if allocated)
aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id <allocation-id>
```

### 6. Clean Up Local Files

```bash
# Remove node modules and build artifacts
rm -rf node_modules/
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf package-lock.json

# Remove any SSL certificates (if created)
rm -rf certs/
```

### 7. Verify Resource Deletion

Check AWS Cost Explorer after 24 hours to ensure no resources are still running:

```bash
# Check for any remaining Bedrock resources
aws bedrock-agent list-knowledge-bases
aws bedrock-agent list-data-sources --knowledge-base-id YOUR_KB_ID

# Check S3 buckets
aws s3 ls

# Check EC2 instances
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?State.Name!=`terminated`]'
```

### Important Cost Notes

⚠️ **OpenSearch Serverless Minimum Charges**: Even when idle, OpenSearch Serverless collections have minimum charges. Delete them when not in use.

⚠️ **Bedrock Model Costs**: Conversations are charged per token. Long conversations can accumulate costs quickly.

⚠️ **Free Tier Limits**: Be aware of AWS Free Tier limits, especially for EC2 and S3.

## Troubleshooting

### Knowledge Base Issues
1. **Knowledge Base Not Responding**:
   - Verify your Knowledge Base ID in `src/client.ts`
   - Check AWS credentials and permissions
   - Ensure knowledge base status is "Available"

2. **Incorrect Health Information**:
   - Verify health documents were properly ingested
   - Check chunking settings in AWS console
   - Ensure source documents are from reputable health sources

### Audio Issues
1. **Microphone Not Working**:
   - Check browser permissions
   - Ensure HTTPS (need to install/add certificate) or localhost
   - Try different browser (recommended to use Chrome)

2. **No Audio Output**:
   - Check browser audio settings
   - Verify WebSocket connection in browser console

3. Error `Error: {"source":"bidirectionalStream","error":{"name":"CredentialsProviderError","tryNextLink":false}}`
   - Check your AWS credentials

### General Connection Issues
1. Check server logs for errors
2. Verify WebSocket connection:
```javascript
socket.on('connect_error', (error) => {
  console.error('Connection failed:', error);
});
```

## Customizing the AI Agent

### **Adding New Tools**

To extend the agent's capabilities with new tools:

1. **Define Tool Schema** (in `src/consts.ts`):
```typescript
export const NewToolSchema = JSON.stringify({
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "parameter": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Parameter description"
    }
  },
  "required": ["parameter"]
});
```

2. **Add Tool to Configuration** (in `src/consts.ts`, within `setupPromptStartEvent`):
```typescript
{
  toolSpec: {
    name: "new_tool_name",
    description: "Tool description for the AI agent",
    inputSchema: {
      json: NewToolSchema
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Implement Tool Logic** (in `src/client.ts`, within `processToolUse` method):
```typescript
case "new_tool_name":
    console.log(`Processing new tool: ${JSON.stringify(toolUseContent)}`);
    return this.processNewTool(toolUseContent);
```

4. **Create Tool Function**:
```typescript
private processNewTool(toolUseContent: any): Object {
    // Parse tool content
    const content = JSON.parse(toolUseContent.content || "{}");
    
    // Implement your tool logic here
    return {
        success: true,
        result: "Tool execution result"
    };
}
```

### **Modifying Agent Behavior**

**System Prompt** (in `src/consts.ts`):
- Modify `DefaultSystemPrompt` to change the agent's personality, capabilities, and conversation flow
- Add new guidelines for tool usage and conversation structure

**Tool Selection Logic**:
- The AI agent automatically selects appropriate tools based on the tool descriptions and system prompt
- Modify tool descriptions to influence when each tool is used

**Safety Boundaries**:
- Update the `safety_response` tool schema to handle new types of inappropriate requests
- Modify the safety response generation logic in `generateSafetyResponse` method

### **Knowledge Base Configuration**

**Updating Knowledge Base ID** (in `src/client.ts`):
```typescript
// Replace with your actual Knowledge Base ID
const KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID = 'YOUR_KB_ID_HERE';
```

**Knowledge Base Query Parameters**:
- Modify `queryHealthKnowledgeBase` method to adjust search parameters
- Change `numberOfResults` for more or fewer search results

### **Audio and Voice Configuration**

**Voice Settings** (in `src/consts.ts`):
```typescript
export const DefaultAudioOutputConfiguration = {
    sampleRateHertz: 24000,
    voiceId: "tiffany", // Change voice here
};
```

Available voice options: `tiffany`, `marcus`, `aria`, `davis`, `jenny`, `gregory`
